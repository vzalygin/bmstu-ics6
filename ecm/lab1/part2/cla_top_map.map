    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of  58,400    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:     15
      Number with same-slice register load:     15
      Number with same-slice carry load:         0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   169 out of  37,680    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          638
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            40 out of     638    6%
    Number with an unused LUT:                 188 out of     638   29%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         410 out of     638   64%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              30 out of 301,440    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
